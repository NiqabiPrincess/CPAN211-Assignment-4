Project Overview:
This project reads hotel data from a text file and stores each line as a Hotel object.
The program demonstrates two types of sorting:

1. Natural Sorting (Comparable)
   - Sorts hotels by star rating (descending)
   - Then alphabetically by hotel name

2. Price Sorting (Comparator)
   - Sorts hotels from the lowest price to highest

Both sorting methods are shown in the console and inside the JavaFX GUI.
The GUI includes buttons for sorting and a Save to File feature that writes the
current hotel list into Sorted.txt.
